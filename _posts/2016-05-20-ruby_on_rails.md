<h4>FILMR</h4>
<a href="http://github.com/empireofryan/filmr">Code on Github</a>
<p>Filmr aims to disrupt Hollywood by enabling creatives to interact direct with an audience. Users can upload screenplays by genre while adding reviews and upvotes.</p>

<p>The current iteration of the app includes a Devise authentication and Facebook Oauth Login. Create a new script, save by genre, and make comments on any script.</p>
