I made the decision to develop after recommending it to so many friends and wondering why I wasn’t doing it myself. Let’s see: 

A lucrative in-demand career
Culture that emphasizes not being an asshole
New interesting situations everyday
Potential to work from anywhere
Having a set of skills that makes you highly sought after

I finally got onto Codeacademy tried it out and realized, I can do this. Actually, I struggled a lot and it was very difficult, but as far as I hear, that’s part of being a developer (or no different to any profession as far as I’m concerned).

I love the idea of being able to build a website and deploy it around the world in seconds. Plus having a great idea for a startup and being able to execute on the concept without the need to hire a developer because - I am one :-)
